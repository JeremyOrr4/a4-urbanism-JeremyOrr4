## How to Run the Program

```
### DECORATING AN EXISTING MESH ###
###################################
###################################
(in main directory)
------(to install)------
mvn clean
mvn compile
mvn package
mvn install
------------------------
(in main directory)
java -jar island/island.jar -i (mesh to be read in) -o (mesh to be outputted and visualized) -h (height of input mesh) -w (width of input mesh)

-----Other Args -----
-help -> help message 
-l -> activates lagoon option 
-lakes (arg) -> specify number of lakes (int)
-p (arg) -> specify elevation profile (Volcano)
-rivers (arg) -> specify number of rivers (int)
-s (arg) -> shape of island (Circle, irregular(default), Square)
-help -> prints help options
Note: if you do not specify a width and height, it will asume the mesh size is 1920x1080.
Another Note: 1920x1080 are also the dimensions which will produce the richest, most realistic island.

-seed (arg) -> specify the seed controlling randomness (defaults to random seed)(All other arguments must be consistent for perfect reproducability) 

-----For the Bonus-----
-v (arg) -> Specify elevation or moisture visualization (Humidity, Elevation)
-------------------------

Island.sh will install program and generate a new mesh and an island. In order for seeds to work properly, the same mesh must be used so the built.sh script decorates and island but does not produce a new mesh.
```

It creates two jars:

  1. `generator/generator.jar` to generate meshes
  2. `visualizer/visualizer.jar` to visualize such meshes as SVG files

## Examples of execution

### Generating a mesh, grid or irregular

```
mosser@azrael A2 % java -jar generator/generator.jar -k grid -h 1080 -w 1920 -p 1000 -s 20 -o img/grid.mesh
mosser@azrael A2 % java -jar generator/generator.jar -k grid -h 1080 -w 1920 -p 1000 -s 20 -o img/irregular.mesh
```

One can run the generator with `-help` as option to see the different command line arguments that are available

### Visualizing a mesh, (regular or debug mode)

```
mosser@azrael A2 % java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar -i img/grid.mesh -o img/grid.svg          
mosser@azrael A2 % java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar -i img/grid.mesh -o img/grid_debug.svg -x
mosser@azrael A2 % java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar -i img/irregular.mesh -o img/irregular.svg   
mosser@azrael A2 % java -jar visualizer/visualizer.jar -i img/irregular.mesh -o img/irregular_debug.svg -x
```

Note: PDF versions of the SVG files were created with `rsvg-convert`.
